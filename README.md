NetConnect
==========
This is a web-based puzzle game inspired by Scrambled Net and KNetWalk. This is mostly an experiment 
in using simple HTML5/CSS/Javascript to create a version of the game. In addition, this iteration
has been converted to a PhoneGap project mostly as an experiment in how well the code performs when
converted. Note that this version isn't perfect and there is plenty of cleanup that can be done; it 
was done mostly for my own experimental purposes.

As the original KNetWalk was released under the GNU Public License V2, as was Scrambled Net, this
project will also fall under the GNU Public License V2.
